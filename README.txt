PONG SDL DEMO

Here's a brief SDL demo I whipped up in about an hour.  It's pretty straightforward
and demonstrates how easy it is to use SDL to get some graphics on the screen.  You
can also see some basic event parsing, screen redraw, and SDL initialization stuff.

It should be pretty self-explanatory.  For more information about SDL check out the
website (http://www.libsdl.org) - be sure to grab the runtime library and put it in
your windows/system folder, or the Pong folder.  If you want to compile it you will
need to get the Development library for whatever compiler you're using.

With the right libraries, this should compile just fine on Windows or Linux without
any changes.  Don't quote me on that though.
